> The project was built in Java 


## `Description `

The purpose of this software project is to develop a super app for travel that provides users with a comprehensive platform for planning and managing all aspects of their travel experience and budget. The app aims to simplify the travel planning process by integrating various services and information into a single, user-friendly platform.<br />

## `Technologies and Tools`

- ### `Spring Boot`
The Spring Framework played a vital role in developing the backend infrastructure. It facilitated handling user requests, processing business logic, and integrating with various services such as flight and hotel providers, payment gateways, and customer management systems.

- ### `MongoDB`
Was employed as the primary data storage solution for the flight and hotel booking system. It offers high scalability, flexibility, and performance, making it suitable for managing large volumes of data. MongoDB was used to store booking details, customer information, flight schedules, hotel availability, and other related data. Its document-oriented approach allowed for easy retrieval and manipulation of data in a flexible manner.

- ### `ActiveMQ Artemis`
We integrated Artemis to facilitate asynchronous messaging and event-driven communication within our system. This allowed us to efficiently handle notifications, updates, and other real-time operations.

- ### `JMS`
In our project, JMS, along with Artemis, enabled reliable and asynchronous communication between different modules, ensuring smooth data flow and event handling.

- ### `Tomcat`
Apache Tomcat is a widely-used web server and servlet container for Java applications. We utilized Tomcat to deploy our backend services, providing the necessary environment for running and managing our Java-based server components.

- ### `React`
Was utilized for building the user interface of the flight and hotel booking system. With React, developers were able to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the application state. The dynamic nature of React made it easier to handle real-time updates, search functionality, and user interactions, providing a smooth and interactive experience for customers when searching and booking flights and hotels.

- ### `Junit`
We employed JUnit to write and execute automated tests for our system's backend components, ensuring the correctness and reliability of critical functionalities.

- ### `Postman`
Postman is a collaboration platform used for testing and documenting APIs. In the flight and hotel booking system, Postman was employed during the
development phase to test and validate the API endpoints responsible for handling flight and hotel bookings. It allowed us to send requests, examine responses, and ensure the smooth functioning of the API services.

- ### `Spring Tool Suite`
We used Spring Tool Suite to write, debug, and manage the source code of our system, facilitating efficient development and collaboration among team members.

- ### `Git`
Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project efficiently. It is commonly used in software development to track changes made to source code and manage different versions of the codebase.

- ### `RapidAPI`
RapidAPI is a platform that allows developers to discover, use, and manage APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) from various providers.
We used the following API: Tripadvisor, Booking, ExchangeRate API.

- ### `Axios`
Axios is a JavaScript library that simplifies sending HTTP requests from a browser. We employed Axios to facilitate seamless communication between the frontend and backend of our system, enabling data retrieval and updating.
Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project efficiently. It is commonly used in software development to track changes made to source code and manage different versions of the codebase.


## `Steps for running the program` 

##### `MongoDB Compass`

- Introduction

MongoDB Compass is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool that allows you to interact with MongoDB databases. This README provides instructions on how to run MongoDB Compass on your system.

- Prerequisites

Before running MongoDB Compass, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

Operating System: MongoDB Compass is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
MongoDB: Install MongoDB Community Edition from the official MongoDB website (https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
MongoDB Compass: Download the MongoDB Compass installation package for your operating system from the official MongoDB website (https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass).
Installation

Download the MongoDB Compass installation package for your operating system from the MongoDB website.
Run the downloaded installation package and follow the installation wizard instructions.
Once the installation is complete, MongoDB Compass will be installed on your system.
Running MongoDB Compass

- To run MongoDB Compass, follow these steps:

Windows:

Open the Windows Start menu.
Search for "MongoDB Compass" and click on the MongoDB Compass icon to launch the application.
MongoDB Compass will open, and you will see the connection screen.
macOS:
Open the Launchpad or go to the Applications folder.
Locate the MongoDB Compass application and click on it to launch.
MongoDB Compass will open, and you will see the connection screen.

- Connecting to MongoDB

Once MongoDB Compass is running, you can connect to a MongoDB database by following these steps:

In the MongoDB Compass connection screen, enter the connection details for your 

- MongoDB server:
Hostname: The hostname or IP address of your MongoDB server - localhost
Port: The port number on which MongoDB is running (default is 27017).
Authentication: If your MongoDB server requires authentication, check the "Authentication" box and provide the username and password.
SSL: If your MongoDB server is configured to use SSL, check the "SSL" box.
Click on the "Connect" button to establish a connection to the MongoDB server.
Once connected, you will see a list of available databases on the left sidebar. Click on a database to explore its collections and documents.
Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully installed and launched MongoDB Compass. You can now connect to your MongoDB server and interact with your databases using the graphical interface provided by MongoDB Compass. Enjoy exploring your data!
